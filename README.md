This is a simple task management program implemented in C++. It allows users to manage tasks, including adding, displaying, modifying, deleting, and saving tasks to a file.

## Features
1. **Add Task**: Allows users to add a new task by providing the task name and category.
2. **Display Tasks**: Displays all existing tasks along with their names and categories.
3. **Modify Task**: Enables users to modify an existing task by providing the old task name and the new name and category for the task.
4. **Delete Task**: Allows users to delete an existing task by providing its name.
5. **Save Tasks to File**: Saves all tasks to a file named "tasks.txt".
6. **Load Tasks from File**: Loads tasks from the "tasks.txt" file if it exists; otherwise, it creates a new file.
